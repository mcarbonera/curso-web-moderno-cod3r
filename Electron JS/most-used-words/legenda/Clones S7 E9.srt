1
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:35,702
<i>Outer Rim under siege!</i>

2
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:38,538
<i>Separatist forces
have launched a major offensive.</i>

3
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:44,085
<i>Led by the evil droid General Grievous,
Republic forces are pushed to the brink.</i>

4
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:46,338
<i>In response to this overwhelming attack,</i>

5
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:48,798
<i>the Jedi Council
has dispatched its Generals,</i>

6
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:53,470
<i>sending them far from the Core Worlds
to bolster the beleaguered clones.</i>

7
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:55,555
<i>On the distant planet of Yerbana,</i>

8
00:00:55,638 --> 00:01:00,560
<i>we find Commander Cody of the 212th
in desperate need of reinforcements.</i>

9
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:02,187
Hit the targets!

10
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:16,368
Take cover! Take cover!

11
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:29,464
Look out! Look out!

12
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:30,757
Look out!

13
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:34,803
Aim for their eyes!

14
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:49,901
General!

15
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,445
Cody, get down!

16
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:03,123
Well, I can see things
are going splendidly on this front.

17
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:05,583
It's no good.
We can't locate the tactical droid.

18
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:07,168
He's staying out of sight.

19
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:14,050
Anakin, where are you?

20
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,301
I'm right here.

21
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:18,805
What are you doing down there?

22
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:22,267
We are taking cover. 
Now get down!

23
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:23,852
You're not serious.

24
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:26,354
There's only a thousand droids
down there, tops.

25
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:29,774
What are you up to? 
Where's Captain Rex?

26
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:32,861
We already finished our battle, so we
decided to come help you with yours.

27
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,363
You're overdoing it. Again!

28
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:38,241
Master, I mean no disrespect.

29
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:40,660
If you want, I can hide here with you,

30
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:42,912
and we can let the people
in the city suffer longer.

31
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,539
Now, Anakin, you know I...

32
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:48,293
Or we can do things my way
and help them now.

33
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:52,589
All right.
I know better than to try and stop you.

34
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:54,299
What's your plan this time?

35
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:55,383
Stay here.

36
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:01,806
One target approaching.
We can't hit it.

37
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,767
Identify target.

38
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:10,148
Cease fire.
All batteries take aim at the Jedi.

39
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:19,074
Ready. Aim.

40
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:22,994
Hold your fire! Hold your fire.

41
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:29,209
I have come to surrender.

42
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:35,048
Surrender? That's a relief.
Notify the tactical droid.

43
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:37,300
Your forces fought valiantly,

44
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:42,055
and I must admit that we are overmatched
by your superior firepower.

45
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:47,727
I congratulate you, for I have fought
in many battles on many planets...

46
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:50,647
always been victorious
against the droid army.

47
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,148
Though you have always...

48
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:55,485
Artoo.
How much longer are we stuck down here?

49
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:57,862
Great. I'll tell the boys.

50
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:00,949
All right, men.
Hang in there a little longer.

51
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:04,327
Sir, yes, sir.

52
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:07,580
So, it is with these thoughts in mind

53
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:13,503
that I gladly surrender myself
to the mercy of the Separatist forces.

54
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,172
Why have you ceased fire?

55
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,592
Jedi Knight, Anakin Skywalker,
has surrendered to us, Commander.

56
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:21,636
There he is.

57
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,681
It's a trap, you fools. 
Open fire!

58
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,057
Now, Artoo!

59
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:07,557
General.

60
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,143
Yes, Cody. You may 
join the fun as well.

61
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:11,436
Yes, sir.

62
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:13,646
Blast them!
Fire!

63
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,699
Go! Go, go, go!
Move it! Move it!

64
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:29,079
Bravo, Anakin. You've done it again.

65
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:31,247
Oh, I can't take all the credit.

66
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:34,751
Your state of helplessness really
sold them on my surrender talk.

67
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,253
Always glad to help, my friend.

68
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:43,051
Skywalker here. What is it Admiral?

69
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:44,928
<i>Sir, we've received a transmission</i>

70
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:48,723
<i>from someone using your
subspace frequency "Fulcrum."</i>

71
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:50,517
Saw Gerrera?

72
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:53,812
Perhaps the siege at Onderon
has taken a turn for the worse.

73
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:56,147
<i>No, sir, it's not Gerrera.</i>

74
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:59,150
<i>You had best take this
transmission here on the ship.</i>

75
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:00,860
<i>Both of you.</i>

76
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:14,290
All right, Admiral.

77
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:18,169
What's so important you
brought us all the way back here?

78
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:28,471
<i>Hello, Master. It's been a while.</i>

79
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:37,355
Ah... Ahsoka. Wha...

80
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,110
I don't believe it!
How are you?

81
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,486
Where are you?

82
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:45,113
Are... Are you okay?

83
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,907
<i>I'm all right. Thank you.</i>

84
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:49,993
<i>I wish we had more time to talk,</i>

85
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,162
<i>but I have urgent
information for both of you.</i>

86
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:54,164
What is it, Ahsoka?

87
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:58,418
<i>Lady Bo-Katan and I have located
the renegade Sith Lord, Maul.</i>

88
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:01,880
<i>And if we move swiftly, we
believe we can capture him.</i>

89
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:18,521
It all makes sense now.

90
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:19,939
What?

91
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:21,316
If Ahsoka hadn't left the Order,

92
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,735
then she wouldn't have been
where she needed to be.

93
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:26,196
That's one way to look at it, I suppose.

94
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:28,823
It's the only way to look at it.

95
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,576
We're gonna capture Maul, finally.

96
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:34,162
I thought you would be
more excited about this.

97
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:37,123
I am cautiously optimistic.

98
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,840
Ahsoka, I'm so glad...

99
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,466
We'll have to catch up another time.

100
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:30,844
Things are moving quickly.

101
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:36,182
Every minute we waste here
gives Maul an opportunity to slip away.

102
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:41,521
We understand. Please, follow me.

103
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:59,873
Bo-Katan had been tracking
Maul's movements for several months.

104
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:03,626
I was able to obtain some transmission
codes from the Pykes on Oba Diah,

105
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,379
which helped her pinpoint
some of his previous locations.

106
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:08,757
What were you doing on Oba Diah?

107
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:13,094
That's a long story and
not really relevant right now.

108
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:15,305
What is relevant

109
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:18,475
is that we know Maul is on
Mandalore in the city of Sundari.

110
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,645
You're certain of this?

111
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:24,689
He arrived two days ago.

112
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,567
So why not take him yourself?

113
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:30,612
Or, to be more specific,
what do you want from the Republic?

114
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:35,450
I don't have the numbers
needed for a siege.

115
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:39,579
Without a complete lockdown of
the city, Maul will escape again.

116
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,998
That's why I'm proposing
a joint operation.

117
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:47,420
If we are successful, you'll have
Maul and I'll have Mandalore.

118
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,927
If Republic forces aid you
in your assault,

119
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,763
it will break treaties
that are 100 years old.

120
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:59,641
We will effectively be drawn
into yet another war.

121
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:01,643
What's one more?

122
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:06,856
Well, we're not finished
with our first one yet.

123
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:12,529
I will advise the Jedi Council
of this development.

124
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:15,657
There's no time!

125
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:21,413
Maul's influence on Mandalore
is destroying my people!

126
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:25,208
He murdered their ruler, my sister!

127
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,919
I thought she meant something to you!

128
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:35,218
She did. And still does.

129
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:38,221
But I cannot allow my feelings
to cloud my judgment.

130
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:41,850
The council will decide
what our course of action will be.

131
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:51,234
I told you this was a waste of time.

132
00:10:57,866 --> 00:11:01,578
So, that went well, all things considered.

133
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:04,456
You two certainly haven't changed.

134
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:06,916
Is that a bad thing?

135
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:12,589
Come on. I have a surprise for you.

136
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:25,935
Commander.
Sir.

137
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,364
They shouldn't salute me anymore.

138
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:39,991
Not since I left the Order.

139
00:11:40,492 --> 00:11:41,701
It doesn't matter to them.

140
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:43,620
It's a sign of respect.

141
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:48,541
They know what you went through for
them, day after day, battle after battle.

142
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:52,837
Loyalty means everything to the clones.

143
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:02,305
Company, attention!

144
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:08,478
Go ahead. They've been 
waiting to see you.

145
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:29,833
As soon as Rex and the guys
knew you were back, they got to work.

146
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:40,260
The paint job is a little crude,
but we think it gets the idea across.

147
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,849
Glad to have you back, Commander.

148
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:48,435
Rex, thank you.

149
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:50,770
But you don't have to call me
commander anymore.

150
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:53,356
Sure thing, Commander.

151
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,527
Oh. I have one more surprise for you.

152
00:13:16,338 --> 00:13:20,300
Anakin, Rex, prepare all forces.
We're jumping to hyperspace immediately.

153
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:21,384
Yes, sir.

154
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:22,927
Men, with me.

155
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,532
Watch it! Watch it!
You heard him, lads! Let's go!

156
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:28,391
So, the attack on
Mandalore was approved?

157
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:30,977
No, it's Coruscant.
Grievous has attacked the capitol.

158
00:13:31,686 --> 00:13:33,063
What about the Chancellor?

159
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:34,689
Shaak Ti has been sent to protect him,

160
00:13:34,773 --> 00:13:36,983
but Master Windu
has lost contact with her.

161
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:41,154
Not to worry.
Our fleet can be there within the hour.

162
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:42,655
So that's it?

163
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,284
You're going to abandon
Bo-Katan and her people?

164
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:50,497
Ahsoka, surely you understand this is
a pivotal moment in the Clone Wars.

165
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,832
The heart of the Republic is under attack.

166
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:56,586
I understand that, as usual,
you're playing politics.

167
00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:00,340
This is why the people
have lost faith in the Jedi.

168
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:01,925
I had too,

169
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:06,221
until I was reminded of what the Order
means to people who truly need us.

170
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:09,015
Right now, people on Coruscant need us.

171
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:12,060
No. The Chancellor needs you.

172
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:13,728
That's not fair.

173
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,522
I'm not trying to be.

174
00:14:17,941 --> 00:14:20,193
I'll divide the 501st,

175
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:22,445
make a new division
under Ahsoka's command.

176
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:27,534
Unfortunately, Ahsoka is no longer a part
of the Grand Army of the Republic.

177
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:33,707
We'll promote Rex to Commander
and have him lead the new division.

178
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,042
Ahsoka can go with him as an advisor.

179
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:37,627
What do you say?

180
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:39,838
I accept.

181
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,882
That is, if Obi-Wan agrees.

182
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:47,345
Very well.

183
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:51,558
May the Force be with you.

184
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:57,981
Oh, one other thing: I killed Maul once.

185
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:59,107
Best to capture him.

186
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,985
He doesn't seem to stay dead.

187
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:08,658
Thanks for the support. As always.

188
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:10,535
That's what friends are for.

189
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:15,707
If you're going to face Maul,
you'll need these.

190
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:32,474
I took care of them. 
They're good as new.

191
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:39,606
Maybe a little better.

192
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:46,446
You capture Maul.
I'll take care of Grievous.

193
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:48,990
With any luck, this
will all be over soon.

194
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:52,410
Master Kenobi always said
there's no such thing as luck.

195
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:54,746
Good thing I taught you otherwise.

196
00:15:58,583 --> 00:15:59,626
Anakin!

197
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:03,254
Good luck.

198
00:16:45,714 --> 00:16:48,967
<i>Commander, I have Prime Minister
Almec of Mandalore on the comm.</i>

199
00:16:49,426 --> 00:16:50,510
Put him through.

200
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,597
<i>What is the meaning of this invasion?</i>

201
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:58,393
<i>The Republic presence here
is a direct violation of our treaty.</i>

202
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:00,478
Your time has come, Almec.

203
00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:04,691
We know you're Maul's puppet,
and we are coming for him.

204
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:09,612
<i>Ah-ha! Mistress Bo-Katan, the traitor.</i>

205
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:12,699
<i>I should have known
you were behind this incursion.</i>

206
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:17,287
<i>Siding with the Republic will make you
an enemy in the eyes of the people.</i>

207
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:19,205
I'm fine with that.

208
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,461
You're nothing like your sister.

209
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:36,222
Saxon, prepare our
forces for an all-out attack.

210
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:38,892
Rook, inform the
syndicate of the invasion.

211
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:45,482
It's been a while since
we had a fight like this.

212
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:47,442
Are you ready?

213
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:06,544
Ursa, can you confirm
the target's location?

214
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:10,340
<i>I can only confirm that
Maul has not left the city.</i>

215
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:13,510
<i>All other attempts to locate
him have been blocked.</i>

216
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:16,304
<i>Saxon is already
scrambling his defenses.</i>

217
00:18:19,641 --> 00:18:21,810
We've got incoming!

218
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:03,018
What are you waiting for? Get out there!

219
00:19:06,229 --> 00:19:08,898
Sorry, I didn't think
to bring you a jetpack.

220
00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:10,608
Don't need one.

221
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:13,653
Race you to the surface.

222
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:52,901
Thanks, Commander!

223
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:30,063
Beat you.

224
00:20:30,397 --> 00:20:31,981
Some things never change.

225
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:58,591
We're meeting stronger
opposition than anticipated.

226
00:20:58,675 --> 00:21:01,428
They've already taken the docks
and are moving on your position.

227
00:21:01,803 --> 00:21:04,806
<i>Escape to the Undercity.
You will be met there.</i>

228
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:06,307
Understood.

229
00:21:25,827 --> 00:21:27,328
No sign of Maul yet.

230
00:21:27,662 --> 00:21:29,664
We can't sustain a long siege.

231
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:32,709
I'll head for the throne room
and deal with Almec.

232
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:35,378
You must find Maul.

233
00:21:40,175 --> 00:21:42,385
I want you to support Ursa at the docks.

234
00:21:42,469 --> 00:21:44,971
We must ensure Maul doesn't escape.

235
00:21:45,263 --> 00:21:46,431
If he's here.

236
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:51,102
If he's not, then all of this
plays right into his hands.

237
00:21:52,729 --> 00:21:56,983
<i>Commander Rex, this is CT-0292.
I think we have something.</i>

238
00:21:57,067 --> 00:21:58,526
I'll be right there, Captain.

239
00:22:20,048 --> 00:22:22,133
Captain Vaughn, what have you got?

240
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:25,345
We were cutting off this
access point to the Undercity,

241
00:22:25,428 --> 00:22:28,682
when we engaged one of
the leadership, Gar Saxon.

242
00:22:28,765 --> 00:22:31,559
He disappeared through there.
Seemed in a hurry.

243
00:22:33,436 --> 00:22:34,771
What's down there?

244
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:39,359
A system of tunnels, sewage ports, mainly.
Some conduit access pipes.

245
00:22:39,776 --> 00:22:41,569
Do they lead outside the city?

246
00:22:41,945 --> 00:22:43,113
Unknown, sir.

247
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,701
Let's move in.

248
00:22:57,877 --> 00:23:00,880
<i>The Jedi was sighted
entering the lower city.</i>

249
00:23:00,964 --> 00:23:03,925
Then it's just as our lord predicted.

250
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:47,635
Where's Maul?

251
00:23:48,094 --> 00:23:50,638
You were never the
politician your sister was.

252
00:23:55,560 --> 00:24:00,523
He wanted you to bring the Jedi here,
but you brought the wrong one.

253
00:24:03,318 --> 00:24:04,486
Ahsoka, come in.

254
00:24:04,819 --> 00:24:06,321
You're walking into a trap.

255
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:07,781
Ahsoka!

256
00:24:50,865 --> 00:24:51,866
Get down.

257
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:02,127
Vaughn, wait!

258
00:25:06,923 --> 00:25:08,341
Look out!

259
00:25:10,301 --> 00:25:11,428
This way! Hurry.

260
00:25:11,761 --> 00:25:13,346
Watch it! Watch it!

261
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:14,889
Stop. Stop!

262
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:30,280
I'm sorry, Commander.

263
00:25:58,641 --> 00:26:02,228
I was hoping for Kenobi.

264
00:26:07,067 --> 00:26:10,278
Why are you here?
